# ML
My ML course project
The purpose of this project is to develop a machine-learning model that predicts high tides in
Venice using meteorological data. High tides in Venice can lead to flooding and other issues,
so accurate predictions are crucial for planning and mitigating potential risks. My code
implements a machine-learning pipeline to train and evaluate a model for this task.
